# README
 
This project builds a length-versatile and noise-robust LoRa radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) system. The LoRa signals are collected from 10 commercial-off-the-shelf LoRa devices, with the spreading factor (SF) set to 7, 8, 9, respectively. The packet preamble part and device labels are provided.
